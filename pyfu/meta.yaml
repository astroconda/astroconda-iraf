    summary: IFU datacube mosaicking package for PyRAF and Python
build:
    number: '1'
    # These must be copied from astroconda-iraf-helpers, as conda unhelpfully
    # disallows the post-install step from depending on other packages:
    always_include_files:
    - bin/ac_config_iraf_pkg
    - bin/ac_update_extern_pkg
package:
    name: pyfu
    version: "0.9"
source:
    svn_url: http://scisoft.gemini.edu/svn/ifudr/pyfu/0.9
requirements:
    build:
    - astroconda-iraf-helpers
    - python x.x                # syntax needed to build for each python ver.
    run:
    - python x.x
    - numpy >=1.9               # (use same version as disco-stu)
    - scipy >=0.14              # (to match the NumPy requirement)
    - astropy >=1.0
    - stsci.imagestats >=1.4
    # PyRAF is an optional dependency if the IRAF interface is used but is not
    # needed by the Python interface so don't require it here, as that would
    # also drag in IRAF etc.
